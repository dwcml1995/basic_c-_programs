In this repository, I will showcase my projects I learn in school through the Tech Academy utilizing C# & .NET :

[Car Insurance Application](https://github.com/dwcml1995/basic_c-_programs/tree/main/MyInsurance/MyInsurance)
[Users Birthday](https://github.com/dwcml1995/basic_c-_programs/tree/main/usersBirthday)

Car Insurance :

This is an App I made with MVC to take in information on a user looking for new car insurance coverage. This takes in a variety of factors, such as age, car year, make and model. It also takes DUI, speeding tickets and the type of coverage into consideration on their claim. There is also an admin view that can see the requests from users.

Users Birthday : 

A console app that prompts the user to enter their birthdate and displays how old they are now. Also included exception handling on this.
